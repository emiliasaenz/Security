# Work Guide: Classical Cryptography

## Part 1: Research Topics

In this section, you will research various classical cryptography topics. Each topic has a set of questions to guide your learning.

### 1. The Substitution Cipher

1. What is the substitution cipher and how does it differ from the shift cipher?

In a substitution cipher, each character in the plaintext is replaced by any different letter, following a specific system that can vary throughout the message depending on a key. This method allows for a wide range of substitutions, making the key more complex and the cipher generally more secure against basic decryption methods like frequency analysis.

A shift cipher, involves a simpler and more uniform substitution method. The alphabet is shifted a fixed number of places either up or down. This uniform shift means the key is simply the number of positions the alphabet is shifted, making it less complex and less secure. With only 26 possible variations in the English alphabet, shift ciphers are more susceptible to being broken, especially through frequency analysis

2. How can you create a substitution cipher using a keyword or a random permutation?

To create a substitution cipher using a keyword, generate a keyword that serves as the key and defines how letters from the cipher alphabet correspond to those in the plain alphabet. Any repeated letters in the keyword are first eliminated. Following this, the cipher alphabet is constructed by aligning the letters of the keyword with A, B, C, and so forth, until all letters in the keyword are utilized. Subsequently, the remaining letters of the cipher alphabet are arranged in their usual alphabetical sequence, while skipping any letters that were already included as part of the key.

To create a substitution cipher using a random permutation, generate a random shuffle of the alphabet, where each letter is uniquely mapped to another. This shuffled list forms the key. Encrypt the plaintext by substituting each letter with its corresponding letter in the random permutation. While this method offers better security than simple ciphers like the shift cipher, it can still be vulnerable to frequency analysis, especially in longer texts. The effectiveness of this cipher heavily relies on the randomness and unpredictability of the permutation.

3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the substitution cipher?

Advantages: 
- Easy and straightforward to understand and implement
- Offers better security than simple shift ciphers due to a larger number of possible keys
- Faster to execute compared to complex encryption algorithms

Disadvantages:
- Can be broken by skilled cryptanalysts using frequency analysis to deduce letter mappings.
- Not suitable for encrypting very confidential data due to their relative ease of being cracked
- Securely sharing the substitution key between sender and receiver can be problematic.
- Limited Key Space due to the limited number of possible substitutions

4. How can frequency analysis be used to break a substitution cipher?

By counting how often each letter appears in the ciphertext and comparing it to the expected frequency of each letter in the language of the plaintex. Also by examing patterns such as common words, letter pairings, and grammatical rules.

5. Can you provide an example of a historical use of the substitution cipher?

The historical use of a substitution cipher is exemplified in the 16th century by Mary, Queen of Scots, during her imprisonment by Queen Elizabeth I of England, where each letter of the alphabet was substituted with a symbol or another letter. Mary utilized a substitution cipher to secretly communicate with her supporters, planning her escape and potentially plotting to assassinate Elizabeth. However, her encrypted messages were intercepted and deciphered by Elizabeth's spymaster, Sir Francis Walsingham, and his cryptanalyst, Thomas Phelippes. The cracking of this cipher exposed Mary's involvement in the Babington Plot, ultimately leading to her trial and execution for treason in 1587.
