For $1 ≤ i ≤ n$, the encryption rule $e_i$ is defined to be $e_i(j) = L(i,j).$ Here, $i$ would be the key, $j$ the plaintext, and  $e_i(j)$ the ciphertext. \n",

    "In the Latin Square Cryptosystem, a cryptosystem is considered to have perfect secrecy if the following conditions are met: \n",
    "\n",
    "For every plaintext p in the set P and every ciphertext c in the set C, the probability of p given c, PrP,C(p/c), equals the probability of p, PrP(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "p ∈ P, c ∈ C, PrP,C (p/c) = PrP (p)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for each p in P and c in C, PrP,C(p/c) equals the probability of p times the probability of c given p, divided by the probability of c\n",
    "\n",
    "p ∈ P, c ∈ C, PrP,C (p/c) = Pr(p).P(c/p) / Pr(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each key is used with the same likelihood, knowing a particular j, there exists a unique key that encrypts j to L(i,j) out of n keys (as each number appears only once in a column). Regarding Pr(c), each L(i,j) occurs n times in the square among the n^2 possible instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Pr(p/c) = Pr(p). 1/n / (n/n^2) = P r(p)\n",

    "Thus, the Latin Square Cryptosystem guarantees perfect secrecy as long as each key is utilized with equal probability\n",

    "Regarding the probability of ciphertexts:\n",

    "Given that the size of P, C, and K are the same, there is only one key among n that encrypts p to c\n",
